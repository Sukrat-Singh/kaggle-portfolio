This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset. The aim is to maximize detection (recall) of fraudulent transactions while minimizing false alarms.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is rare (<0.2% of transactions), making standard accuracy metrics misleading. The challenge is to correctly detect fraudulent transactions while avoiding unnecessary false positives.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Rows:** 284,807 transactions  
- **Fraudulent cases:** 492 (~0.17%)  
- **Features:** PCA-transformed (V1‚ÄìV28), plus `Time` and `Amount`  
- **Target:** `Class` (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud)  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset is not included due to size constraints (>150MB). See **Data** section below.

## üîç EDA & Preprocessing

- Confirmed **extreme class imbalance**  
- Checked for missing values ‚Üí none  
- Scaled `Amount` feature  
- Stratified K-Fold used for train-test splitting  
- Applied **SMOTE** on training folds only  
- Threshold tuning applied to improve recall

---

## ü§ñ Model

- **Algorithm:** RandomForestClassifier  
- **Training Strategy:** Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation  
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE oversampling  
- **Threshold Tuning:** Adjusted probability threshold to improve recall

## ‚úÖ Results

| Metric                 | Before Threshold Tuning | After Threshold Tuning |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mean Recall            | 0.83                    | 0.87                   |
| Mean Average Precision | 0.85                    | 0.85                   |
| Accuracy               | 99.8%                   | 99.8%                  |

> Custom threshold significantly reduced false negatives while keeping false positives manageable.
